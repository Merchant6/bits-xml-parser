			<p>Women Filmmakers in Sinophone World Cinema portrays a group of important contemporary women filmmakers working across the Sinophone world including Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China, and beyond. The book delineates and conceptualizes their cinematic and trans-media practices within an evolving, multifaceted feminist intimate-public commons. The films by these experienced and emerging filmmakers, including Huang Yu-shan, Yau Ching, Ai Xiaoming, Wen Hui, Huang Ji and others, represent some of the most innovative and socially engaged work in both fictional and non-fictional modes in Chinese-language cinema as well as global women’s cinema. Their narrative, documentary, and experimental film practices from the 1980s to the present, along with their work in sister media such as dance, theater, literature, and contemporary art, their activities as scholars, educators, activists, and film festival organizers or jurors, have significantly reshaped the landscape of Sinophone film culture and expanded the borders of world cinema.</p>

				<abstract xml:lang="en"><p>The introduction outlines the historical and conceptual contours of the book centered on a group of uniquely important but under-studied women filmmakers working across the Taiwan Strait particularly and the Sinophone world at large. I synthesize a trans-Asian perspective and a locally grounded cine-feminist framework invested in the cultivation of an intimate-public commons. The main objective is to highlight women’s contribution to, and intervention in, the male-dominant New Wave Chinese-language cinemas and the attendant nationalist and academic discourses, while anchoring Sinophone cine-feminist currents in studies on the critical place of women’s cinema in world cinema and social transformations.</p></abstract>

These films probe the tension between romantic love and “kin-love” in Chinese culture through moving portrayals of women’s independence and bonding across generations and geographical locations.</p></abstract>

Among the defining characteristics of her films are a deep commitment to women’s issues, local culture (especially her native Penghu Island and the south), and postcolonial Taiwan historiography.</p></abstract>

The transformational and comparative project on juvenile delinquency, adolescent femininities and masculinities, and state-sanctioned social conformity offer an instructive case study of minor transnationalism through a queer lens.</p></abstract>
